Planning a virtual documentary screening seemed like a fantastic idea. I envisioned a cozy online gathering for "[Golden Wings: 50 Year Flight Path](http://wwww.golden-wings-robyn.com)" where everyone could enjoy my latest work, blissfully unaware of the chaos that awaited me. Little did I know, my meticulous preparation would soon unravel into a tapestry of hilarious mishaps and frustrating roadblocks. Grab your popcorn, folks—this is the tale of how I almost derailed my own premiere.

## The Perfect Plan (Or So I Thought)

Three weeks before D-day, I launched a marketing blitz that would make Don Draper proud. [Facebook](//www,facebook.com/calebmillsstewart), [TikTok](http://www.titok.com/@calebmills99), [Reddit](https://www.x.com/calebmills99)—if it had a scroll feature, I was there, shouting into the digital void about my upcoming screening. The cherry on top? It was scheduled for my mom's birthday. She'd be in Japan, but she promised to join, adding a sprinkle of sentimentality to my grand vision.

## Marketing Madness: The Molasses Effect

![](https://indiedocjourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/calebstewart__frazzled_markete_in_a_social_media_maze_it_is_a_b_27c40444-f32c-4965-8f30-5c96c853c5be.png?w=1024)

I marketed like a caffeinated squirrel, scattering ads across the internet with reckless abandon. But the sign-ups? They trickled in slower than molasses flowing uphill in January. Each ping of a new registration felt like a hard-won victory. Friends and family eventually rallied, bless their hearts, even if their numbers were more "intimate gathering" than "viral sensation."

## Tech Troubles: When 8GB Feels Like 8KB

The big day arrived, and in a stroke of what I thought was genius, I decided to make a new cut of my documentary. My trusty MacBook Pro, armed with a modest 8GB of RAM, wheezed at the mere suggestion. Editing became a Herculean task, like trying to squeeze an elephant through a garden hose.

My poor [MacBook](http://www.golden-wings-robyn.com/birthday-screeening), overwhelmed by the data onslaught, threw in the towel. It crashed more times than I care to count, spitting out videos that were either mute as a mime or glitchier than a scrambled cable channel circa 1995.

## The Great RAM Upgrade: A Race Against Time

Realizing I needed more horsepower, I bit the bullet and ordered a new desktop with 16GB of RAM, with plans to upgrade to 32GB. Amazon promised the additional RAM would arrive the Friday before the screening. Spoiler alert: it didn't. The package finally graced my doorstep Sunday afternoon, mere hours before showtime.

## DIY RAM Installation: Fumbling Towards Glory

Picture this: me, armed with a YouTube tutorial and a prayer, attempting to install RAM for the first time. My hands shook like I was defusing a bomb rather than upgrading a computer. For an agonizing hour, I fumbled with tiny screws and delicate components, feeling less like a tech wizard and more like Mr. Magoo in a microchip factory.

Miraculously, the computer booted up. I had done it! But my victory dance was short-lived—I now had precious little time to finish editing.

## Platform Panic: The Last-Minute Switch

T-minus one hour, and a horrifying realization struck: Zoom required downloads. My tech-challenged attendees would struggle more than a cat in a bathtub. Cue frantic platform switch to Google Meet.

This eleventh-hour change meant guiding my jet-lagged mom through setup from her hotel in Japan. Her Wi-Fi connection was spottier than a dalmatian, and her patience was wearing thinner than hotel toilet paper. But bless her, she persevered.

## The Screening: Murphy's Law in Action

Finally, fashionably late by 30 minutes, the screening began. My audience? A whopping three people: my first-grade teacher (bless her supportive soul), my cousin (family obligation at its finest), and my mom's high school friend (curiosity trumps convenience).

But wait! The universe wasn't done with me yet. The video streamed beautifully—a silent film for the modern age. No audio. Nada. Zip.

For ten excruciating minutes, I flailed at my computer like a cartoon character swatting flies. My audience watched in bemused silence as I morphed into a living embodiment of the buffering symbol.

## The Silver Lining: A Birthday to Remember

Despite the technical tempest, a warm glow emerged. There was my mom, beaming from her hotel room in Japan, celebrating her birthday in the quirkiest way possible. My first-grade teacher's familiar smile brought a wave of nostalgia. And my mom's high school friend? She got a front-row seat to a comedy of errors she never signed up for.

In the end, I admitted defeat gracefully(ish) and promised to send everyone a link to the rough cut. Not quite the premiere I'd envisioned, but a memorable one nonetheless.

## Ending on a Sweet Note (Literally)

After the dust settled, I crafted an email to my loyal attendees and those who signed up but couldn't make it. It took me a good 30 minutes to write, each word carefully chosen and coming straight from the heart:

> 
"Well, that was a hoot and a half!!

Thank you all for attending. It was very sweet. As an actor, I get these nightmares of being on stage in a play with no recollection of ever having rehearsed or learning any lines. It's called the actor's nightmare, and I've yet to meet an actor who hasn't experienced it. I now know what the director's nightmare is - I've lived it. It's inviting people to come see your work and then the movie not playing! LOL!

On the bright side, I got to see my Mom for her birthday. I also got to see my first-grade teacher Kathi, cousin Kathy and Gene, and meet Paula! Thanks again to all of you.

I'm including the Google Drive link to the full rough cut of the documentary.

The only thing I ask is that you watch it because my Mom was so incredibly brave and let herself become vulnerable in front of the camera. The heart of any good documentary is truth, and you see something real here. My mother's bravery, humility, and good humor are all on display in this film. It is moving and captivating, and I plan on showing it to the world!

To those of you who could not attend, I'm sending you the link as well. It was my fault we got started late, so you should get to see it too. It's a rough world out there, so let's all try to make it a better place while we have the gift of being here.

Warmest regards,

Caleb Mills Stewart"

As soon as I finished writing, I called my mom to read it to her. I couldn't make it through without my voice cracking and tears welling up. She told me it was beautiful and that she thought it was a wonderful birthday present, technical difficulties and all. Her words meant the world to me.

## The Emotional Undercurrent

![](https://indiedocjourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/untitled-2.png?w=683)

As I reflect on this experience, I realize that my emotional response wasn't just about the screening. I'm currently remastering the ending of the documentary, which deals with a deeply personal event: my Dad's sudden passing while my Mom was on duty in Frankfurt.

It's been ten years, but the grief is still there, a constant companion that ebbs and flows. Most days, I think of him with a smile, remembering his patience, wisdom, and love for laughter. Other times, like now, I find myself misty-eyed, wondering what he would say about my latest project.

I was one of the lucky ones, gifted with a wonderful father. His laugh was infectious, a sound I'd give anything to hear just one more time. Miss you, Dad. Love you.

## Conclusion: A Screening to Remember

While my virtual screening didn't go as planned, it became so much more than just a premiere. It was a roller coaster of emotions, a test of resilience, and a reminder of what truly matters. The technical glitches and low turnout fade in importance when I think about connecting with my mom on her birthday, reuniting with my first-grade teacher, and feeling my dad's presence in the work I'm doing.

This experience taught me valuable lessons about filmmaking, sure, but more importantly, it reminded me of the power of vulnerability, the strength of family bonds, and the unexpected ways our loved ones continue to shape our lives.

Next time, I'll be better prepared for the technical challenges, more flexible in my approach, and maybe – just maybe – I'll crack the code of getting more sign-ups. But no matter what happens, I'll carry with me the knowledge that it's not about perfect executions or massive audiences. It's about the stories we tell, the connections we make, and the love we share.

And that, technical difficulties and all, is worth every moment of effort.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

(Or as I like to call them, "Frightfully Awkward Quandaries")

**1. What inspired you to create "Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path"? Was it a sudden desire to become the Scorsese of the skies?**

Picture this: There I was in graduate school, enrolled in a documentary filmmaking class, probably wearing a beret and pretending to understand French New Wave cinema. Our final assignment was to create a 10-minute documentary. Being the brilliant strategist that I am, I thought, "Aha! I'll take the easy way out and make a doc about my mom's 53-year career as a flight attendant!"

Spoiler alert: It was about as "easy" as trying to fit a Boeing 747 into a parking spot at the mall. I'd unknowingly signed up for the filmmaking equivalent of an ultra-marathon... in flip-flops... uphill... both ways. But hey, sometimes taking the "easy" way out is just life's way of tricking you into doing something amazing. How delightfully, frustratingly human of me!

**2. How do you handle technical difficulties during screenings? Interpretive dance? Smoke signals? Carrier pigeons?**

First step: Resist the urge to have a full-blown, toddler-style meltdown in front of your audience. Save that for later, preferably in the privacy of your car or a large, soundproof closet.

Second: Channel your inner swan - all grace and poise on the surface, while paddling frantically underneath. Apologize to your audience with the smoothness of a used car salesman and the sincerity of a golden retriever.

If all else fails, have a backup plan. Mine was to give everyone a link to the rough cut of the documentary. It's not password protected because apparently, I like to live dangerously. Or I trust people. Or both.

Remember: If you can't give them a show, at least give them a story to tell at parties!

**3. What are your top tips for marketing a virtual event? Wrong answers only, please.**

Well, folks, gather 'round for a masterclass in "What Not To Do in Marketing 101." First tip: Cast a net so wide, you're basically fishing in the Sahara.

I focused on Facebook with the dedication of a cat ignoring its expensive new toy. Spoiler: It worked about as well as using a flyswatter to catch a whale.

Then there was Reddit, where I got more engagement than a ring shop on Valentine's Day, but about as many sign-ups as a voluntary tax seminar.

My eyes were bigger than my "digital stomach" - a metaphor so bad, it's probably causing English teachers worldwide to wake up in a cold sweat.

Pro tip: If you want to learn about marketing, just do the opposite of whatever I did. You'll be fine!

**4. How do you stay motivated during challenging projects? Caffeine? Inspirational cat posters? Interpretive screaming?**

Ah, motivation - that elusive unicorn of productivity. My secret? I try to remain reflective, which is a fancy way of saying I stare at myself in the mirror and ask, "Why? Why did you do this to yourself?"

I also take breaks when needed, even though I feel guiltier than someone eating the last slice of pizza without offering to share. But sometimes, you need to step back and look at the bigger picture. It's like trying to solve a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle of the sky - at some point, you need to stop staring at that one blue piece and remember there's a whole image you're working towards.

Remember: It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. A never-ending marathon. With hurdles. And maybe some quicksand. But hey, at least the scenery is interesting!

**5. What's next for you in your filmmaking career? Planning to document the secret lives of airline peanuts, perhaps?**

Well, first on the agenda is actually finishing "Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path." I know, wild concept, right? Finishing what I started? Revolutionary!

After that, I'm diving into new projects faster than a kid cannonballing into a pool on the first day of summer. I'm talking new stories, new techniques, maybe even figuring out which end of the camera to point at the subject!

If "Golden Wings" takes off (pun absolutely intended), I might expand it into a feature-length documentary. Think of it as "Golden Wings: Now With Extra Legroom." We'll explore more stories from the friendly skies, like:

- The great airline deregulation: Or as I like to call it, "The Day the Peanuts Stopped Being Free"

- The impact of the AIDS crisis on the flight attendant community: A heartbreaking but important chapter

- The strikes of the early '90s: Because nothing says "job satisfaction" like standing on a picket line in uncomfortable shoes

So buckle up, keep your tray tables in their upright and locked position, and stay tuned. This filmmaker's career is cleared for takeoff!
