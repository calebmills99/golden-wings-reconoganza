## Usage Options

### 1. Preview Mode (Recommended First)
`powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File "D:\golden-wings-reconoganza\execute_renames_20250927_100312.ps1" -WhatIf
`
This shows what would be renamed without making any changes.

### 2. Standard Execution with Backup
`powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File "D:\golden-wings-reconoganza\execute_renames_20250927_100312.ps1"
`
Renames all files and creates backup copies in a timestamped backup folder.

### 3. Execution without Backup (Use with caution)
`powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File "D:\golden-wings-reconoganza\execute_renames_20250927_100312.ps1" -NoBackup
`
Renames files without creating backups. Only use if you have other backups.

### 4. Force Overwrite Existing Files
`powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File "D:\golden-wings-reconoganza\execute_renames_20250927_100312.ps1" -Force
`
Overwrites destination files if they already exist.

### 5. Custom Log File
`powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File "D:\golden-wings-reconoganza\execute_renames_20250927_100312.ps1" -LogFile "my_rename_log.txt"
`
Saves execution log to a custom file location.

## Safety Features

- **Backup Creation**: Automatic backup of original files (unless -NoBackup)
- **Collision Detection**: Warns about existing destination files
- **Directory Creation**: Automatically creates destination directories
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed log of all operations
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing even if individual files fail
- **What-If Mode**: Preview changes before applying

## File Summary
- Total mappings loaded: 46
- Valid files found: 46
- Missing source files: 0

## Recommended Workflow
1. Run with -WhatIf first to preview changes
2. Review the proposed renames carefully
3. Run without -WhatIf to execute (backup will be created automatically)
4. Check the execution log for any issues
5. Verify renamed files are correct

## Rollback Instructions
If you need to restore original filenames:
1. Locate the backup folder (backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
2. Copy files from backup folder back to their original locations
3. Use the execution log to identify which files were renamed
