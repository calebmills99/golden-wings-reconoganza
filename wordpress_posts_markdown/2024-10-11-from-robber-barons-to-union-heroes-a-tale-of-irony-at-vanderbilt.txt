**Introduction:** I never imagined that creating a [documentary](http://www.golden-wings-robyn.com) about my family’s aviation legacy would bring me face-to-face with the shadow of one of America’s most notorious robber barons. Yet, here I am, tangled in a historic irony: trying to honor two lifelong union members in my family, only to be blocked by an institution founded by none other than Cornelius Vanderbilt—the very symbol of worker exploitation during America’s Gilded Age.

This story isn’t just personal; it’s emblematic of a broader historical tension between the elites who amassed wealth through questionable means and the working class whose labor fueled that wealth. And today, that tension remains alive in ways that are as infuriating as they are ironic.

## The Gilded Age and Its Legacy

To fully appreciate the irony at play, we need to take a step back into the late 19th century, the era known as the Gilded Age. It was a time of rapid industrialization and staggering wealth disparities. Cornelius Vanderbilt, along with others like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, stood as towering figures in the world of business. Their names became synonymous with ruthless tactics that included monopoly-building, undercutting competition, and, above all, exploiting workers.

Vanderbilt's empire grew out of railroads and shipping, industries that depended on the labor of thousands of men and women, often working in horrific conditions. Workers during this time had little to no bargaining power. Safety standards were lax, hours were long, and wages were low. These industrialists, often referred to as robber barons, seemed to care little about the people whose hands and sweat enabled their fortunes. The workers were tools in the grand scheme of economic expansion, discarded or replaced when no longer useful.

And yet, here we are in the present day, where Vanderbilt's name endures, attached to an elite institution—[Vanderbilt University](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/14/us/tennessee-vanderbilt-university-medical-center-investigation-transgender-reaj/index.html)—founded in part to whitewash that legacy of exploitation. It’s one of many ironies that continue to play out in the relationship between wealth, power, and labor in America.

## The Vanderbilt Irony

As a filmmaker, I set out to document the lives of two people who mean the world to me—[my mother](https://www.openpr.com/news/3673317/turning-a-school-project-into-an-award-winning-festival-gem), a flight attendant for over five decades, and my [grandfather](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/colleyville-tx/jay-ricks-7618288), a World War II veteran who went on to work for American Airlines. These are individuals who, through their union membership, fought for better working conditions, fair pay, and job security, not only for themselves but for the many workers who came after them.

The irony? When I approached Vanderbilt University for access to its archives to aid my research, I was met with a flat refusal. Despite being a recent film school graduate, despite working on a small budget, and despite the historical significance of the story I wanted to tell, the institution founded by Cornelius Vanderbilt—the ultimate symbol of worker exploitation—offered no assistance.

It was a frustrating but telling moment. Here I was, trying to celebrate the contributions of union members who helped create safer, more equitable workplaces, only to be denied by an institution that owes its existence to a man who would have despised the very idea of unions.

**Unions and the Real Legacy:** The irony doesn’t stop with Vanderbilt University’s refusal to assist me. It goes deeper, into the very heart of what I’m trying to document. My mother and grandfather represent the success of labor movements in America—movements that rose up in response to the kind of exploitation that people like Vanderbilt epitomized.

It’s thanks to unions that my mother could build a career spanning 50 years in the aviation industry, benefiting from fair wages, regulated working hours, and safety standards that would have been unthinkable in Vanderbilt’s time. My grandfather, a man who fought for freedom in World War II, returned to a country where he could find work in a unionized industry, one that offered protection and security that wouldn’t have existed just a few decades earlier.

Unions, in many ways, are the antithesis of the robber baron mentality. They exist to ensure that workers are treated fairly, that their voices are heard, and that they aren’t discarded when they are no longer seen as profitable. It is because of unions that the aviation industry transformed from a dangerous, uncertain job to one that offers stability and a reasonable quality of life.

**The Power of Unions in Modern Times**

As a proud member of the Actors’ Equity Association, I know firsthand the value of unions. They’re the reason I’ve had the opportunity to work in safe environments with fair pay and adequate breaks. They ensure that even in industries like film and theater, where competition is fierce and opportunities are often scarce, workers are protected from exploitation.

This is the legacy I want to honor with my documentary. It’s not just a story about my family; it’s a story about the countless workers whose lives have been improved by unions. It’s about the progress we’ve made in ensuring that labor is treated with the dignity and respect it deserves. And it’s about the ongoing fight to protect those gains from being eroded by the same forces that once exploited workers with impunity.

**Moving Forward with or Without Vanderbilt**

Despite the refusal from Vanderbilt University, I remain undeterred in my mission to tell this story. In fact, the university’s rejection has only strengthened my resolve. It has highlighted the stark contrast between the world of privilege and wealth that Vanderbilt represents and the world of hard work, sacrifice, and collective action that my family and so many others have lived.

This documentary will get made, with or without Vanderbilt’s help. And in doing so, it will serve as a reminder that while institutions may be built on the fortunes of robber barons, it’s the workers who truly build society. Their contributions, their stories, and their legacies are what matter most.

**Conclusion**

The irony of my situation hasn’t escaped me, but it has also given me new clarity. The spirit of the Gilded Age may still linger in institutions like Vanderbilt University, but the strength of the stories I’m telling—stories of workers, unions, and family legacies—will always prevail. Cornelius Vanderbilt may have had the money, but my family, and families like ours, have something far more important: the heart, the will, and the spirit to fight for what’s right.

For anyone else working on projects that celebrate the unsung heroes of history—whether they be union workers, family members, or anyone who has fought for fairness—know this: your stories matter. And while the forces of wealth and power may try to block you, they can never silence the truth.

**FAQs**

Why did Cornelius Vanderbilt’s wealth come at the expense of workers?Vanderbilt built his fortune during a time when labor protections were virtually nonexistent. Workers had little to no rights, and industrialists like Vanderbilt exploited this by paying low wages and providing unsafe working conditions to maximize profits.

How have unions helped transform industries like aviation?Unions have been instrumental in advocating for safer working conditions, fair wages, and benefits for workers. In aviation, unions helped establish regulations that made flying safer for both workers and passengers.

What is the irony behind Vanderbilt University’s refusal to help with the documentary?The irony lies in the fact that Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune by exploiting workers, founded an institution that is now refusing to support a documentary that honors union workers who fought for fair treatment and better working conditions.

Why are unions still important today?Unions continue to play a critical role in protecting workers’ rights, ensuring fair wages, and maintaining safe working conditions. They provide a collective voice for workers in industries that might otherwise exploit them.

Can documentaries help preserve union legacies?Yes, documentaries are a powerful tool for preserving and highlighting the legacies of union workers. They offer a platform to share the stories of those who fought for the rights and protections many workers enjoy today.

What lessons can be learned from the Gilded Age?The Gilded Age teaches us about the dangers of unchecked wealth and power. It highlights the importance of labor movements and the need for protections to ensure that workers are treated fairly and justly in any industry.
