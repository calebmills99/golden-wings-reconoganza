## Yay!!

I'm thrilled to share some fantastic news with all of you! My documentary, Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path, has been awarded Best Documentary at the NYC Independent Film Festival!

## The Journey to Recognition

Creating Golden Wings has been a labor of love, one that chronicles the rich tapestry of aviation history intertwined with personal stories. This documentary is more than just a film—it's a tribute to my mother's lifelong dedication to American Airlines and a reflection on how the airline industry has evolved over the decades. The journey from conceptualization to completion was filled with challenges, from navigating technical hurdles to finding the right narrative voice. But every obstacle was a stepping stone, leading us to this moment of recognition.
