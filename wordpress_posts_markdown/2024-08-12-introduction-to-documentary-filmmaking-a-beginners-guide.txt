**[Documentary filmmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film)** is a powerful medium that allows creators to explore real-life stories, issues, and events through the lens of a camera. It's storytelling at its finest—presenting facts, emotions, and narratives rooted in reality. For beginners, stepping into the world of documentary filmmaking can be both exciting and daunting.

Now, let's start small. You, Dear Reader, should begin with a short one- or two-minute documentary. Grab a friend (victim?) and do a basic interview with some non-invasive questions. You might ask:

"How many fingers am I holding up?"

"When was a time in your life when you were really happy?"

"What is your favorite movie?"

"What day is it today?"

"Who is the president?"

Okay, those last questions were jokes. Don’t ask anyone those unless you’re a medical professional. I read somewhere that you should introduce the tone of a piece as soon as possible, so here goes: "Okay, Siri. Set tone to sassy."

This guide offers insights and tips for new documentarians, drawing from my personal experiences and what works for me. Got questions? Feel free to email me at caleb@indiedocjourney.com.

### Understanding the Genre

Documentary films are non-fictional, aiming to depict reality in a way that is both informative and engaging. Unlike fictional films (spoiler alert: narrative films aren't real), documentaries don't rely on scripts or actors to tell a story; instead, they draw on real-life events, people, and locations. These films cover a wide range of topics, from social issues and historical events to personal stories and cultural phenomena. They’re so beloved they even inspired their own subgenre: the mockumentary.

**Fun Fact:** Did you know the mockumentary and the monokini were released in the same year? (I made that up.)

The key to a successful documentary is presenting the subject matter in a way that resonates with the audience, offering new perspectives and insights. If you're considering becoming a documentary filmmaker, you’re likely already a fan, having seen dozens of documentaries that inspire and inform your storytelling. I’m in the same boat—constantly updating my list of documentaries that move me. Remember, though, no matter how much you think you know, there’s always room for growth. And hey, who says a "How To" guide can’t be fun?

### The Pre-Production Phase

Before picking up a camera, a significant amount of work goes into pre-production. This stage involves researching your topic, developing a concept, and planning how you’ll tell your story. Research is crucial—it gives you a deep understanding of your subject and ensures that your documentary is accurate and informative.

For example, during the making of my documentary, I spent hours diving into the Internet Archive, hunting for content that showcased the evolution of the commercial aviation industry. I also watched old news segments on the Archive about the challenges airlines faced over the years. This not only provided me with captivating B-roll but also armed me with well-researched questions for the people I was interviewing.

Once you’ve got a solid understanding of your topic, start developing your film's concept. Define the central theme or message, identify key characters or subjects, and outline the narrative structure. It’s also essential to consider the logistics of your project—budget, equipment, scheduling. Tools like Google Docs for planning, Celtx for scripting, and Trello for task management can be your best friends during this stage.

### Storytelling Techniques

Storytelling is the heart of documentary filmmaking. A well-crafted documentary should have a clear narrative arc—beginning, middle, and end. This structure helps guide the audience through the story, keeping them engaged and invested.

There are several techniques you can use to tell your story effectively:

- **Interviews** with key subjects provide personal insights and emotional depth.

- **Archival footage and photographs** offer historical context.

- **Voiceover narration** ties the narrative together, providing additional information or commentary.

- **Visual metaphors, music, and sound design** can enhance the emotional impact of your film.

I recommend studying mythology and rituals and embracing this simple idea: Human beings like stories told a certain way. It’s in our genes—primal and powerful. But don’t take that as a reason not to innovate. While these concepts have made me a better storyteller, breaking the mold can lead to extraordinary results.

### Filming and Production

Once your pre-production work is complete, it’s time to start filming. This phase involves capturing all the footage you need to tell your story. This can include interviews, B-roll footage, and any other visual elements that will help bring your narrative to life.

When filming, stay flexible and open to new ideas. Documentary filmmaking often involves capturing real-life events as they happen, which means unexpected opportunities or challenges may arise. Being adaptable and responsive to these moments can lead to some of the most powerful and authentic footage.

**Pro Tip:** BACK UP YOUR FOOTAGE. Seriously, have a backup of your backup and then another backup for that one. Losing footage will feel like losing a loved one. BACK IT UP.

### Editing and Post-Production

Post-production is where your documentary really comes together. This stage involves editing your footage, adding music and sound effects, and finalizing the film's overall structure. Editing is a critical part of the process—it allows you to shape the narrative, create pacing, and emphasize key moments in your story.

During editing, you might realize your original concept or structure needs adjustments based on the footage you captured. This is normal and can often lead to a more compelling and cohesive final product. Stay true to the essence of your story while being open to creative changes. Software like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve are great tools to explore during this stage.

For example, during post-production, I realized that my documentary needed voice-over narration to bring everything together. Initially, I relied too heavily on my subject, which could make the audience feel overwhelmed by the constant talking. Subconsciously, viewers might think, "This person has been talking non-stop—they must be exhausted." It’s natural to want to give someone a break, even in a film. Whether through a different interview, a narrative sequence, or a musical interlude, it’s important to vary the pacing. My documentary initially lacked these breaks, so I used voice-over narration to provide them. This decision, which I hadn't anticipated during filming, emerged entirely in post-production.

### Distribution and Promotion

Once your documentary is complete, the final step is getting it in front of an audience. There are several ways to distribute and promote your film, including film festivals, online platforms, and social media. Film festivals are an excellent way to showcase your work to a wider audience and gain recognition within the industry. Online platforms like YouTube or Vimeo offer an accessible way to reach viewers around the world.

Promoting your documentary is essential for attracting viewers and generating interest. This might involve creating a website or social media presence for your film, reaching out to media outlets for coverage, and engaging with potential audiences through screenings and events. Building an email list and connecting with communities interested in your topic can also drive engagement.

I’ve found TikTok to be an effective tool for gauging interest in your documentary. The platform’s focus on short, engaging visual content pushes you to think creatively about how to keep your audience engaged in a limited amount of time. It also ensures that every clip and sequence is essential, captivating, and leaves viewers wanting more. TikTok's trial-and-error approach lets you test different strategies, troubleshoot what doesn’t work, and find your niche audience. The hashtag #TikTokDoc is particularly useful for this purpose. Do you have any tips or tricks for promoting your own work?
