"The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection."— George Orwell

In life, we often find ourselves navigating through routine, habit, and expectation, forgetting that some of the most crucial moments are those when we truly show up—fully present, alive, and engaged. There's something deeply powerful about the act of being there when it counts. Whether you're delivering a performance on stage or handling critical responsibilities in any profession, this act of showing up is the invisible force that drives success, trust, and fulfillment.

**Showing Up: A Commitment to the Present Moment**

As a filmmaker and actor, I’ve always believed in the importance of being fully present, of showing up for life and work in a way that goes beyond just being there physically. Whether it's on stage or behind the camera, there’s a certain urgency in being in the moment—alive, engaged, and ready to deliver. This has been at the core of my journey as a storyteller, from childhood to my most recent work, *Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path*. This documentary, which pays tribute to my mother’s remarkable career with American Airlines, explores a similar commitment to presence—a concept that has shaped both her life and mine.

**The Power of Presence: Lessons from the Stage**

Theater demands a kind of authenticity that’s unlike anything else. There are no second chances. Every moment is live, and it’s fleeting. For me, being fully present from the first rehearsal to the final bow is non-negotiable. The energy I feel when I step onto those creaky floorboards, the flicker of lights overhead, the thick air laced with dust—it’s an experience that resonates deeply in my bones. The audience, waiting in the dark, becomes part of that shared experience, and each line spoken is like a living thing, blooming and fading in the same instant.

**There’s something about that stage life that you can feel down to your bones—the flicker of the lights, the creaky floorboards beneath your feet, the thick, musty scent of dust clinging to the red velvet seats. The key lights glow overhead, barely anchored by an underpaid techie’s handiwork, while cobwebs linger in the corners like old memories from long-forgotten shows. Each line spoken is like a bud on a vine—delicate, full of life for just that fleeting moment, only to be clipped bare when the curtain falls. The performance, once roaring and alive, vanishes into the air, a brief blaze of magic, gone too soon, but destined to return in another night’s show.**

That feeling is one that stays with me long after the applause fades. On stage, there’s no opportunity to pause, no rewinding or second guessing. In that moment, you give everything. That blend of nerves and confidence, the delicate balance between preparation and improvisation, feels very much like life itself. We often stand at that same intersection in our everyday lives—balancing what we know with what is unknown, and in every instance, we’re expected to show up.

**The Stage as a Metaphor for Life**

In many ways, the world itself is a stage, and our lives are filled with performances where we’re expected to rise to the occasion. Whether it’s a significant career moment, a personal challenge, or simply a meaningful conversation, we are all actors in those moments. Just like in theater, life is about being prepared to respond in real-time. There’s no room for hesitation. Every moment counts, and there’s no replay.

For me, every performance has been like a fleeting burst of magic. The energy roars to life on stage and then fades when the curtain falls. And yet, those moments of intensity carry lessons that stay with me. Life, too, is filled with these bursts—times when we give our all, only to move on to the next scene. But showing up in those moments, even if they are brief, is where the real magic happens.

**Aviation: The Urgency of Now**

My understanding of showing up isn’t just confined to my experiences as a filmmaker or actor. Growing up in a family deeply connected to aviation, I saw parallels between the urgency of performing on stage and the responsibilities of those in the aviation industry. My mother, Robyn Stewart, worked for American Airlines for over fifty years. Her role wasn’t just a job; it was a lifelong commitment to showing up when it mattered most.

Just like a live performance, when a flight is in progress, there’s no going back. Each takeoff, each landing—it’s a high-stakes performance in its own right. The margin for error is non-existent, and the stakes are high. The job demands focus, resilience, and precision, just like the moments under the spotlight. There’s no pause button in the air, just like there isn’t one in life or on stage.

I’ve watched my mother show up time and time again—whether it was during moments of crisis or simply serving her passengers with grace and care. The moment the last passenger exits the plane is much like the final curtain call. The plane, once filled with noise and motion, becomes quiet, waiting for its next flight, its next performance.

**Golden Wings: A Legacy of Showing Up**

That dedication to showing up is what inspired me to create my documentary, *Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path*. The film is a tribute to my mother’s extraordinary career and her lifelong dedication to excellence. It celebrates not only her legacy but also the deep connection our family has to aviation. For fifty years, my mother didn’t just go to work—she showed up, fully present and accountable, every single day.

Telling her story, and through that, telling my own story, made me realize how much this idea of showing up defines who we are. Whether it’s through my work as a director, an actor, or a storyteller, my commitment to being present is the thread that ties everything together.

**Why Showing Up Matters in Life**

Whether in the theater, on a plane, or in everyday life, showing up is far more than just being present. It’s about truly being there—engaged, focused, and giving your best. Life doesn’t come with rehearsals. We get one shot at each moment, and how we show up defines not only our success but also our legacy.

When we show up for the people we love, we strengthen our relationships. When we show up in our work, we build trust and respect. And when we show up for ourselves, we create opportunities for growth and fulfillment.

**Embracing the Urgency of Now**

Showing up is about embracing the present moment. Whether on stage, at work, or in our personal lives, every moment deserves our full attention. Opportunities to be fully present come and go, and when we seize them, we unlock something extraordinary.

Just like in theater or aviation, showing up requires dedication, practice, and a deep understanding that what we do in the moment can have a lasting impact. It may not always be perfect, but showing up is the first step in making those moments meaningful.

**Each line spoken is like a bud on a vine that gets clipped when the curtain falls, much like the moment the last passenger leaves the plane. It’s a moment in time, once roaring and alive, gone too soon but soon to return. Thusly, there is the essence of being alive while we have the gift of it.**
