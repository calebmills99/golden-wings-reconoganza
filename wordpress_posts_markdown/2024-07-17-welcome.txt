## **The Story Behind ‘Golden Wings’**

‘Golden Wings’ began as a humble film school project, shot entirely on my Samsung Galaxy S20 with no budget. This documentary chronicles the remarkable 50-year career of my mother, Robyn Stewart, a pioneering flight attendant. From small-town beginnings to globe-trotting adventures, her story is truly inspiring. The film also pays homage to my grandfather, a WWII veteran and influential figure at American Airlines, who designed and directed the pilot training program for the Boeing 747.

Does anyone else reading this have an aviators in their family or are you one yourself? I'd love to hear from you in the comments!

**Overcoming Challenges**

Creating this documentary was filled with challenges and triumphs. With no budget and only a Samsung Galaxy S20, I relied on creativity and resourcefulness to bring the project to life. In this blog, I’ll share behind-the-scenes stories and the lessons learned during the making of 'Golden Wings.'

**Family Legacy in Aviation**

‘Golden Wings’ delves into my family's deep connection to aviation. Beyond my grandfather's pivotal role at American Airlines, my uncle also made significant strides in aviation technology. Our family gatherings often echo with captivating anecdotes about our shared passion for flight. This documentary captures these stories, celebrating our enduring aviation legacy.

**A Struggle Overcome**

One of the most powerful aspects of my mother’s journey has been her resilience in the face of personal challenges. Her determination to overcome these obstacles has been inspiring and is an integral part of her story. Her experiences serve as a testament to the strength and perseverance required to overcome personal battles while maintaining a successful career.

**The Future: ‘Little Birdies’**

If ‘Golden Wings’ continues to gain momentum, I plan to expand it into a feature film titled ‘Little Birdies.’ Now is the perfect time to connect with me as this documentary gains traction. I'm currently managing everything solo and would appreciate help in production, post-production, marketing, or distribution. If you have relevant skills, I’d love to hear from you.
