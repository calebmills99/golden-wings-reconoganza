## While Scrolling Through the Past: My Galactic Dive Into Papa’s Legacy

While digging through the archives, I found myself scrolling through Papa's obituary—yes, a deep dive into the nostalgia vortex. Buckle up, babes! The words were all there: WWII vet, aviation legend, devoted family man. Sweet, for sure. But honestly? It felt like giving you a sparkling tiara with no rhinestones. Where’s the *real* shine, darling?

And then, oh *ho ho*, there was more! A little ol' comment section at the bottom. You know the kind—filled with the typical, “So sorry for your loss” and “He was a great man.” Classic, polite, beige. But this time? Something caught my eye, making me pause mid-scroll, head tilted, giving a big ol’ side-eye, like, *“Wait a second, what’s this?!”* 👀

## A Message From the Past: Jock Spills the Tea 💖☕

BAM—there it was. A comment from none other than Jock Bethune. You know, the guy I’d sat down with just months earlier for the tea spill of a lifetime. And hunny, when I read Jock’s words, it hit *different*. Deep in my sparkly, Slayton-loving soul.

> 
“God bless you, Jay! You and I worked together on that 747 program at the Flight Academy! You’re the best!”

Let me tell you, this wasn’t just some casual nod—oh no. This was Jock serving up the *truth*, no filter. Papa was *the best*. He said it, and we’re putting it in lights, baby. Period. ✨💅

Alright, listen, darlings, not even Miss Frizzle—that old minx—had anything on my Papa. She had a magic school bus? Well, Papa had a *magic jumbo jet*, baby! I’m talking Corinthian leather, and Ricardo Montalbán lounging in first class, sipping Sanka.

And yes, babes, I could just picture it—fabulous suit and all, in that '70s glory, while cruising right into the Slaytonverse. You know, the kind of coffee that makes you feel like you’re in a '70s TV lounge with all the vintage glamour. 🌟✨

Naturally, after reading Jock's words, I had to revisit his interview. I pulled it up, and hunny, let me tell you—it hit in a whole new way. This vibe wasn’t just about Papa’s responsibilities—it was all about his *legacy*, his glow, his *Slayton energy* in full swing.

## Legacy Beyond the Manuals: Papa’s Real Influence 🌟💫

Papa wasn’t just out there ticking boxes, sweetie. He was out there transforming lives, changing the game, and bringing his sparkle. Whether it was training pilots to soar or teaching us grandkids how to read ‘Matt the Rat’ before we even hit preschool—Papa brought the magic. He made learning an adventure, and that spirit? He poured it into *everything* he did. No exceptions. ✨💫

Growing up, I had no idea of the true scale of his influence. To me, he was just *Papa*—the guy who played baseball with me. (Oh yes, this fabulous storyteller even played little league baseball with toy cars in the outfield! Don’t worry, darling, I see the glamour in it.) He was Hooked on Phonics before it even existed. Back then, the only thing people were getting hooked on was… well, I digress. 😂

The point is, hunny, Papa was *it*. My sweet Papa beamed with pride every time we learned something new. And now? Now I see he was a whole galaxy unto himself—changing lives, shifting worlds, and doing it all with love. That’s what makes this story *one for the stars*, darling. And we’re blasting it all the way to the Slaytonverse! I'm talking Tom Cruise-jumping-on-Oprah's-couch-level love of reading, and that passion is still alive today. He is why this fabulous queen can read books *and* spill the tea on messy queens. 🚀💖✨

## The Real Takeaway: Honoring Our Own 🌌✨

Papa's story isn't just about the man who built training programs or served in WWII. It's about a legacy of *real connection*, of making life an adventure for those around him, of spreading love and laughter in everything he did. And if we can take anything from this, it’s that the real magic lies in the way we choose to inspire, teach, and leave our mark—no matter where life takes us.

So, here’s to Papa. To legacies that shine, to families who lift each other up, and to the Slayton energy that keeps us going. Let's make our stories sparkle and spread our love all the way to the stars, babes! And honey, Papa loved being silly. Learning was serious stuff, but it’s okay to get a little goofy sometimes. Like when you want to spend 30 minutes writing a blog post about your documentary process as if it were a drag queen story sesh—do it, baby! Just make it good and then back to work, hunty. He was the OG Slayton Iconique. ✨💖🛫
