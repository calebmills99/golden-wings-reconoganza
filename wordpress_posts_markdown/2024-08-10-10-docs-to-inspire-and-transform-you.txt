A documentarian stands at the ready

#### Introduction

I have been watching documentaries religiously since I was a teenager. I can't remember the first one that I watched, but I remember watching them with my father on PBS. He used to love nature documentaries and other types of science documentaries as well, and I sort of veered off into other realms of documentaries from watching them with him. Ever since, if you put a documentary in front of me, I will watch it till the end. I love documentaries. As soon as a documentary comes on Netflix, I am probably the first person to watch it. I've loved documentaries since I was a child, and my passion for them has never waned. This list was hard to make because I have so many favorites, but these are the ones that have influenced my own documentary work and my sense of what it is to be a documentarian.

Documentaries have a unique way of delving into the depths of real-life stories, often leaving us with a newfound perspective on the world. They can be profoundly moving, educational, and transformative. In this blog post, I want to share 10 documentaries that have inspired me deeply, reshaping my understanding of various aspects of life. Among them, "The Stories We Tell" by Sarah Polley stands out as the most influential, and I'll tell you why.

## [THE STORIES WE TELL BY SARAH POLLEY](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2366450/)

**Summary:** A meta-documentary exploring family secrets and the subjective nature of truth and memory.

Sarah Polley's "The Stories We Tell" is perhaps the most influential documentary on my list. It tells a deeply personal and intimate story, painting a vivid picture of Polley's family and their history. The film explores the concept of family secrets and the narratives we build around them, delving into how these narratives shape our perceptions of ourselves and our loved ones.

It is what I would call a "meta-documentary." The film is very self-aware, with Polley preferring to appear in front of the camera rather than behind it. Her father, who is also an actor, narrates the film with a charming British accent, adding a layer of warmth and authenticity. There are even reenactments of scenes from key points in the relationship between her father and her mother, which blend seamlessly with home video footage and interviews with family members.

One of the most striking aspects of "The Stories We Tell" is its exploration of the subjective nature of memory and truth. Polley doesn't shy away from presenting conflicting accounts of events, allowing viewers to see how different family members recall the same moments in divergent ways. This approach not only underscores the complexity of family dynamics but also highlights the elusive nature of truth itself.

Polley masterfully captures the essence of what it means to be a family, highlighting both the flaws and the love that bind us together. The documentary delves into deeply personal themes such as identity, forgiveness, and the passage of time. It moved me to tears, showcasing the true love of family despite its imperfections.

## DARK DAYS BY MARC SINGER

https://youtu.be/pr2v4kQM-y0

**Summary:** A raw portrayal of homeless individuals living in New York City's abandoned subway tunnels.

"Dark Days," directed by Marc Singer, is an absolutely captivating portrait of human ingenuity, survival, and resilience. This 2000 documentary focuses on a group of people living in an abandoned train tunnel underneath New York City. Singer, who lives among the tunnel dwellers, captures every aspect of their existence—their struggles, their community, and their humanity.

The film highlights the conditions that people will accept when they are at their lowest and most vulnerable, but it also uplifts by showing the resilience of these individuals. Some of them go on to better lives, but the documentary captures them in their raw humanity, concerned about their pets and striving to keep their makeshift homes free of rats.

"Dark Days" is particularly influential to me because it is made with a zero budget, showcasing the power of storytelling through sheer determination and creativity. Singer's intimate perspective makes this a powerful, unforgettable documentary.

Singer's hands-on approach not only provided him with unique access to his subjects but also helped him to create a visually compelling and emotionally resonant film. The stark black-and-white cinematography adds to the raw and gritty feel of the documentary, emphasizing the harsh realities of life underground. Despite the bleak circumstances, the film is filled with moments of warmth and humanity, as the tunnel dwellers form a tight-knit community, sharing resources and supporting each other.

- GREY GARDENS BY ALBERT AND DAVID MAYSLES

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpNKFq3L900

"**Summary:** An intimate look at the eccentric lives of a reclusive mother-daughter duo living in a decaying mansion.

"Grey Gardens" is another one of my absolute favorites. When I saw it for the first time, I tried to get every single person I knew to sit down and watch it with me. I was absolutely captivated by the world that Albert and David Maysles were able to document. It was surreal, heartwarming, disgusting, and comfy all at once.

This documentary is inhabited by two eccentric, lovely souls: the mother, Big Edie, and her daughter, Little Edie, who live together in a decaying mansion. Their relationship is reminiscent of a character from a Dickens novel—an old woman still wearing her wedding dress in a decrepit house. It's a codependent relationship, unhealthy yet filled with love. The film showcases their lives, trapped in time together, and it's both beautiful and sad.

"Grey Gardens" changed my mind about what documentaries could do, presenting a mix of emotions that are indescribable. There is a perennial debate that asks whether these women were exploited by the filmmakers. Do we choose to believe that two show-business-savvy women with a knack for putting on a show could really be so naive? Or do we see that they recognized a potential opportunity to cement their legacy in their own unique way?

At its heart, it's a documentary about family. It's about love, leaning on one another, needing one another, and caring for one another through the worst times and the best times. This documentary shows both sides of that coin. Unfortunately, these ladies are in one of their worst times when the documentary is filmed, but they hark back to the days when they would be at the beach and have wonderful parties.

- WON’T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR? BY MORGAN NEVILLE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh2XyZQSK4g

**Summary:** A heartwarming exploration of Fred Rogers' life and the impact of his children's television show.

"Won't You Be My Neighbor?" is the documentary to watch if you were a child of the '70s, '80s, or '90s—and even beyond, as Mr. Rogers' show is still being shown on PBS. This film captures the essence of Fred Rogers, a phenomenon of pure light and love. Watching this movie will make you feel good.

Fred Rogers was truly an angel among men. He cared deeply about children and was dedicated to making their lives better. I've read his autobiography, and it's clear that he used his platform on PBS to do just that. Through "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," he taught generations of children about kindness, empathy, and the importance of feeling valued.

Fred Rogers also played a pivotal role in securing funding for public broadcasting. There's powerful footage of him speaking in front of a congressional committee about the importance of funding independent art, which is incredibly moving. His heartfelt plea helped ensure the continuation of PBS, illustrating his commitment to nurturing young minds.

As a poor documentary filmmaker, I know that if I had the funds to make my documentary with a big budget, it would be amazing. But you know what? Documentaries aren't about money. They're about heart, and this documentary has plenty of it. Fred Rogers' legacy proves that impactful storytelling comes from the heart, not the wallet.

- DAUGHTERS BY NATALIE RAY AND ANGELA PATTON

https://vimeo.com/378415906

**Summary:** A heart-wrenching and heart-warming look at a special "Daddy Daughter Dance" program for incarcerated fathers and their daughters.

I saw "Daughters" while working for the Sundance Film Festival in 2024, and it absolutely broke my heart. This gorgeous film is about a daddy-daughter dance, but it just so happens that the daddies live in a correctional facility. These men have not had the opportunity to visit with anyone because of the COVID-19 pandemic for years. Fortunately, an exception is made for this daddy-daughter dance, part of a fatherhood program in Washington, DC.

The documentary does not shy away from showing you things that will probably make you cry. It's wonderful to see the daddy-daughter dance come to fruition, with the daughters reuniting with their fathers after years of separation. The joy and connection are palpable, but so is the heartbreak when the dance ends, and the girls have to leave, not knowing when they will see their fathers again.

"Daughters" highlights the emotional toll of prolonged separation due to pandemic restrictions, especially on the children who didn't choose this situation. It also shows the hope and motivation these events can provide for incarcerated fathers, giving them something to look forward to and strive for. Some scenes are absolutely crushing, while others are incredibly uplifting. Be ready to bring a box of Kleenex if you watch this film.

- MATT SHEPARD IS A FRIEND OF MINE BY MICHELE JOSUE

*A scene from "Matt Shepard is a Friend of Mine"*

**Summary:** A personal exploration of Matthew Shepard's life and the impact of his tragic death on friends and family.

"Matt Shepard is a Friend of Mine" is a powerful feature documentary about Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old gay man who was brutally murdered in one of the most notorious hate crimes in U.S. history. Directed by Michele Josue, a close friend of Shepard's, the film revisits the shocking case with never-before-seen photos, rare video footage, and new revelations about Shepard's all-too-brief life.

I was in high school in 1997 when Matthew Shepard was killed. His death inspired me to go back to school and face the challenges I was experiencing. After being outed, my life had become a living hell. I was spat on in the hallways, beaten up in bathrooms, and called derogatory names everywhere. I just couldn't take it anymore, so I stopped going to class. Matthew Shepard's tragic story inspired me to fix my situation and go back to school. The people who bullied me needed to see that I was stronger than them and stronger than their hate.

This documentary about Matthew and his friends—those who knew and loved him—is absolutely touching and heart-wrenching at the same time. It's a beautiful story, so well told and put together. I had the opportunity to hear Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, speak when I was in college. She is a triumph of love, still holding the love for Matthew that led her to create the Matthew Shepard Foundation. After her speech, I got to talk to her and tell her that I didn't drop out of high school because of Matthew's story. We both cried and hugged, and she told me that I would go on to do great things. Thank you, Judy Shepard, and thank you, Matthew. I'm a documentary filmmaker today because of you.

- BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE BY MICHAEL MOORE

*The K-Mart scene from "Bowling For Columbine"*

**Summary:** A provocative examination of gun violence in America, centered around the Columbine High School massacre.

"Bowling for Columbine," directed by Michael Moore, is a documentary that showed me the power of film to be provocative, evocative, and a genuine agent of change. Moore inserts himself right into the middle of the action, driving the narrative with his relentless pursuit of answers and accountability. This documentary is his best work, in my opinion, as he takes on the mission to seek justice for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre.

I was in high school my senior year when Columbine happened, and the tragedy still affects us today. Moore's fearless approach in confronting the issues of gun violence is compelling. One of the most powerful scenes is when Moore visits the headquarters of K-Mart with two victims of the Columbine massacre, leading the company to agree to stop selling bullets that same day. The looks on those two children's faces when they realized they had the power to make a difference is unforgettable.

The scene with Charlton Heston is particularly powerful. Michael Moore is fearless in his interview with the president of the NRA, who remains steadfastly remorseless throughout the interview. Moore proceeds to make him visibly uncomfortable through his line of questioning that is unrelenting, unapologetic, and brave.

This film also taught me that documentaries can be cinematic box office hits. They can make money; they don't have to be just for a small niche audience. They can appeal to mainstream American audiences and worldwide audiences as well. Moore's approach to filmmaking combines investigative journalism with cinematic flair, making complex and often controversial topics accessible and engaging to a broad audience.

- GRIZZLY MAN BY WERNER HERZOG

*The trailer for "Grizzly Man"*

**Summary:** A fascinating portrait of Timothy Treadwell, an amateur naturalist who lived among wild grizzly bears in Alaska.

"Grizzly Man," directed by Werner Herzog, will change the way you think about man versus nature. The documentary presents a profound debate: Are humans part of the natural world, or are we separate from it? Can we return to nature, or are our modern adaptations too ingrained? Timothy Treadwell, the subject of this documentary, is an enigma of a human being. He had two contrasting sides to his personality, making him a fascinating subject for Herzog.

Herzog masterfully inserts himself into the documentary, offering his own opinions and perspectives, whether they are accurate or not. This film taught me that as a filmmaker, you can insert your own viewpoints into your piece; you don't need to cite anyone because you're the source. It's like creating your own sandbox where you build and destroy as you wish. Herzog's sandbox in "Grizzly Man" is a masterful one.

Timothy Treadwell's story is both sad and inspiring. He attempted to become one with grizzly bears, ultimately failing tragically. Treadwell spent 13 summers living among the grizzlies in Alaska, filming his interactions and advocating for their protection. His passion for these majestic creatures is evident, but so is his naivety and eventual downfall. "Grizzly Man" is a cautionary tale, but it doesn't discourage pursuing one's dreams; rather, it suggests showing some restraint.

- UNZIPPED BY DOUGLAS KEEVE

**Summary:** An intimate behind-the-scenes look at fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi's creative process.

"Unzipped," directed by Douglas Keeve, is a captivating documentary about fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi. I first watched this documentary as a closeted boy in high school, and it transported me away from small-town Texas, giving me bigger dreams to aspire to. This film showed me that, even if you're gay, you can be happy and successful, and your dreams can come true.

Isaac Mizrahi is an absolute delight to watch in this movie. He's a mix of madness and raging creativity, never turning down his energy from level 11. Mizrahi is a jumble of nerves and energy, with a sprinkle of this and that, and a dollop of unpredictability. "Unzipped" is captivating, with parts that will make you laugh out loud.

What sets "Unzipped" apart is its intimate portrayal of the fashion world through Mizrahi's eyes. The documentary offers a behind-the-scenes look at the preparation for Mizrahi's 1994 fall collection, capturing the frenetic pace and high stakes of the fashion industry. Keeve's camera follows Mizrahi as he sketches designs, fits models, and navigates the challenges of bringing his vision to life.

There is an unforgettable scene where the legendary Eartha Kitt asks Isaac to design some dresses for her. It's a wonderful little scene, just the cutest little anecdote in the documentary. Kitt is at her wackiest, and Isaac, being pretty crazy and wacky himself, is left absolutely speechless. This scene, along with many others in the movie, will charm you to death.

- ALL THAT BREATHES BY SHAUNAK SEN

**Summary:** A poignant exploration of two brothers running a bird hospital in Delhi, India, amidst increasing pollution and urbanization.

"All That Breathes," directed by Shaunak Sen, is a captivating documentary that portrays a bird hospital in Delhi, India. The film follows two brothers who take care of kites—birds affected by the ever-increasing urban landscape and pollution of the city. The brothers' selflessness and unconditional love for these birds are incredibly moving.

Despite receiving no funds and relying solely on donations, the brothers run the bird hospital out of pure passion. They also operate an electronics repair business to support their mission. The film showcases their hard work, especially during the monsoon season when their hospital becomes flooded. It highlights their determination to create a new space for the bird hospital as they run out of room.

This documentary is not just about the birds; it's equally about brotherly love. The brothers face the incredible burden of caring for these birds with almost no resources. Their quiet, steadfast support for one another in this endeavor is a central theme of the film. They don't express their love out loud, but they demonstrate it through their actions and deeds. The film beautifully shows that love doesn't always have to be loud; it can be expressed quietly and powerfully through unwavering dedication and mutual support.

One particularly moving shot focuses on a puddle with a piece of trash and a centipede crawling across it, while an airplane flies overhead in the reflection. This accidental yet poignant shot encapsulates the film's message that we need to be better stewards of our natural world as we continue to expand and evolve. It symbolizes the delicate balance between the natural world and human development, highlighting the impact of urbanization on wildlife.

BONUS: WAITING FOR GUFFMAN

*An audition for "Red, White, and Blaine!" from Waiting for Guffman*

**Summary:** A hilarious mockumentary about a small-town theater troupe preparing for their big break.

This film is not only one of my favorite documentaries, but it's also one of my favorite films of all time. To be fair, it is not actually a documentary; it is a parody of a documentary. But sometimes parodies are even better than the real thing, and this is definitely one of those cases. "Waiting for Guffman" is a mockumentary about a small town in America's heartland, Blaine, Missouri, which has a thriving theater community led by Corky St. Clair. Every year, he produces a Fourth of July extravaganza that includes the local community and showcases their acting skills, singing talent, and dance attempts.

It is a standout film not only about community theater but also a loving satire of documentaries themselves and how seriously they tend to take themselves. It's an absolute delight to watch. Christopher Guest directs and stars in it, and we have the incomparable Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy, years and decades before their successful TV show "Schitt's Creek." The cast also includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, and appearances by David Cross, Bob Balaban, and Michael Hitchcock.

It is also a musical treat, with all sorts of wonderful new earworms written for the movie by Christopher Guest and company. It's all improv; there is no script for this movie, making it even more delightful to watch, knowing that none of this was really planned other than just an outline of the plot. "Waiting for Guffman" is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. You don't have to be a theater person to understand it; it's about community. It's a movie about community and what it means to be a part of one, how our community shapes us, and how we shape our community.

It's about the love we have not only for our passions but also for the people with whom we get to share those passions. Those relationships can be rocky, filled with jealousy, admiration, and pride. This movie displays all the various facets of that complicated relationship that you have not only with your art but with the people you create art with. It's a joy to watch, especially around the Fourth of July, capturing the spirit of the holiday.

So let's go, PEOPLE!!!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMERICA!!!!

RED WHITE AND BLAINE, BABY!!!! 🎆⭐

Amen, and Godspeed.

P.S. This being such a brilliant film, the title is a parody of "Waiting for Godot" by Samuel Beckett as is the ending of the movie itself.

P.P.S. My favorite song in the show is "Stool Boom" 💺💩

## Conclusion: The Transformative Power of Documentaries

These ten documentaries, plus our bonus mockumentary, represent just a fraction of the powerful, thought-provoking films that have the ability to change our perspectives and deepen our understanding of the world. From intimate family portraits to societal critiques, and even loving parodies, each of these films offers unique insights into the human experience.

What makes documentaries so impactful is their ability to present real stories, often untold or overlooked, in ways that resonate deeply with viewers. They challenge our preconceptions, evoke empathy, and inspire action. Whether it's Fred Rogers' unwavering kindness, the resilience of homeless tunnel dwellers, or the comedic portrayal of small-town theatrical ambitions, these films remind us of the diverse tapestry of human experiences.

As we navigate an increasingly complex world, documentaries serve as powerful tools for education, empathy, and social change. They encourage us to look beyond our own experiences and consider different perspectives. In doing so, they not only inform but also transform, leaving lasting impressions that shape how we view ourselves and the world around us.

I encourage you to explore these documentaries and others. Each viewing is an opportunity for growth, understanding, and inspiration. Let these real-life stories (and even the fictional ones that feel real) move you, challenge you, and perhaps even change you.
