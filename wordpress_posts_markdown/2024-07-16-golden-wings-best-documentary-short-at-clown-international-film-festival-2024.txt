Hello, everyone!

I am thrilled to share some incredible news with you all. My documentary, **“Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path,”** has been awarded **Best Documentary (Short)** at the **Clown International Film Festival** for the season of April to June 2024! 🎉

**About ‘Golden Wings’**

“Golden Wings” chronicles the remarkable 50-year career of my mother, Robyn Stewart, a pioneering flight attendant whose journey took her from a small-town dreamer to a globe-trotting adventurer. The documentary captures her experiences, challenges, and triumphs as she navigates the skies from Rome to Tokyo and beyond.

**The Journey**

This project started as a humble film school assignment that I never thought would see the light of day. With no budget and only my Samsung Galaxy S20 to shoot with, I embarked on this journey with limited resources but a lot of passion. It all changed when I shared the idea with a friend in LA. They were intrigued and asked to watch the truncated 9-minute version. After viewing it, they were moved to tears and remarked on what a compelling person my mom was. That moment made me realize that this story needed to be shared with the world.

From there, the journey of “Golden Wings” took flight. Remarkably, the film’s success came even as a rough cut, demonstrating the power of the story and the impact of my mother’s journey. Paris welcomed us warmly, marking a significant moment in my grandfather’s legacy. He has returned in spirit to the land of the people he helped liberate during World War II. My mother frequently flies to Paris, and I hope that someone might recognize her on the streets of this beautiful city. I love Paris and look forward to visiting soon to personally thank the wonderful people at Clown International Film Festival.

**A Struggle Overcome**

One of the most powerful aspects of my mother’s journey has been her struggle with alcohol. Her resilience and determination to overcome this challenge have been inspiring and are an integral part of her story. Her experiences serve as a testament to the strength and perseverance required to overcome personal battles while maintaining a successful career.

**Special Screening Event**

To celebrate this achievement and Robyn's birthday, I am hosting a **special virtual screening** of “Golden Wings” on **July 21, 2024, at 9 PM EST | 8 PM CST | 6 PM PST**. The film is only 19 minutes long, and the entire event won’t go past an hour. It’s completely free to sign up!
